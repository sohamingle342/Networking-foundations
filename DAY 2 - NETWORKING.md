Day X+1: Physical Network Segmentation & Infrastructure Layout
🧠 Core Concepts Learned
The DeMark (Demarcation Point): This is the exact physical line where the internet provider's (ISP) responsibility ends and your responsibility begins. If a tree knocks out a wire before this point, the ISP fixes it for free. If a wire breaks after this point inside your building, it's on you.

Property Management DeMark: In big multi-story office buildings, there are actually two boundaries. The ISP drops the line at the building's basement (Demark 1), and then the building's property manager runs a cable up to your office door (Demark 2). If rats chew a cable inside the walls between floors, it's the building manager's job to fix it, not the ISP's.

MDF (Main Distribution Facility): The central hub or "heart" of your network. This is the main server room where the external internet line comes in, and it houses your core routers, main switches, and central patch panels where everything ultimately connects together.

IDF (Intermediate Distribution Facility): These are smaller, secondary network closets located on different floors or in different buildings across a campus. Instead of running 100 long, expensive cables from every single computer down to the main MDF basement, you run them to that floor's local IDF closet first.

DMZ (Demilitarized Zone): A physical or logical buffer zone used to separate public, insecure things from your private, secure network. By using a two-router setup, you put high-risk targets (like a public web server or guest Wi-Fi) behind the first "open" router. Your critical private data (like company databases) sits safely behind a second, highly locked-down router.
